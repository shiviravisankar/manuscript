            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The book provides 3 main takeaways,
            <ul>
            <li>Learn to recognize exclusion and when it occurs</li>
            <li>Learn & take the right inferences from diversity</li>
            <li>Solve for one, extend it across many</li>
            </ul>
            
                The idea of universal design is powerful. Designers often rely on generalizations across many dimensions of design-thinking, ultimately resulting in sterilized solutions befitting of both everyone and no one. Mismatch is a short look at ways that people feel excluded through design. Holmes opens the book focusing on in-group/out-group mentalities, arguing that inclusivity is possible through inclusive design processes. She follows a “Who, What, Why, When, How” model that serves her argument well. 
            
                Sometimes designed objects reject their users, products and infrastructures designed by designers leave out entire populations who cannot use them. A computer mouse that doesn't work for left-handed people, or a touchscreen payment system that only works for people who read English phrases, have 20/20 vision, and use a credit card. People in wheelchairs for whom access to certain buildings is impossible. Similarly, racialized people are confronted with facial recognition systems that are set up to distinguish only white-skinned people.The small size of some women forces them to wear shoes in the children's department. Each of these examples is a "mismatch", a design anomaly that deprives a group of people of the use of a product. From these mismatches comes a strong feeling of exclusion. How can we proceed to design and innovate in an inclusive way?

            <p>Something as simple as color choices can render a product unusable for millions. These mismatches are the building blocks of exclusion. In Mismatch, Kat Holmes describes how design can lead to exclusion, and how design can also remedy exclusion. Inclusive design methods―designing objects with rather than for excluded users―can create elegant solutions that work well and benefit all.</p>
            <blockquote><q>An inclusive environment is far more than the shape of its doors, chairs, and rampways. It also considers the psychological and emotional impact on people.</q></blockquote>
            <blockquote><q>Accessibility, sociology, and civil rights weren't required curricula for learning how to build technology.</q></blockquote>
            <b>Three Fears of Inclusion</b><br><br>
            <i>Inclusion isn't nice</i><br>
            <body>A fear of using the wrong words, and offending people, must be worked through. Many organizations can use the right words but really not mean it or care to implement any change. Develop a shared language to support inclusion.</body> <br>
            <i>Inclusion is imperfect</i> <br>
            <body>You can't design a solution for absolutely everyone. But that shouldn't stop you from trying.</body><br>
            <i>Inclusion is ongoing</i><br>
            <body><u>No solution is perfect. Every solution needs care and maintenance over time, and the field of inclusion itself is developing and in search of a better vocabulary.</u></body><br>
            <blockquote><b>Each time we remedy a mismatched interaction, we open an opportunity for more people to contribute to society in meaningful ways. This, in turn, changes who can participate in building our world.
            </b></blockquote>

            <p>You can't say “you can't play” — those in power, and those who like control, object to this rule, but it has incredibly positive impacts on those that are repeatedly excluded. <del>And the negatives realized by the objectors can often be counteracted by the contributions added by those newly included.</del>

                “We shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us.” The solutions we produce change society and all future solutions must reflect the previous solutions that have shaped society.</p>
